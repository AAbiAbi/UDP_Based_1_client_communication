# UDP Protocal-based communication with one client
COEN 233 Computer Networks.

Program assignment 1: 

Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for sending information to the server.

## Installation
Python 3.9.12

## Usage
There are two ways to use the project.
### Conbination
If you want to activate the server and client at one time, then you can run main.py for procedure 1 and main1.py for procedure 2 .
The console will return the conbinations of the results from client and server. But it still easy to read.

As you can see, the"------------------------------" represent the client sending message. After that the server response in "==================="block.
Then the client show the received message from server below.

The very similar solution to check the reject messages.
![alt text](pic/procedure1.png)
Apperently, in this pic, server reject the packet beacuse of 'Out of Sequence'.
So does the client realizes that. It gives a "...." to resend the message again.
When you run the code, you will find that the resend time is three, not infinitely sending.



### Seprated
If you want to observe the output seperately from client or server, you can run UDP_client.py. There is an entrance of code within. 
Especially when you want to test Time Expired situation, you can run UDP_client.py only.


## Explaination
### Procedure:

The client sends five packets (Packet 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to the server.
The server acknowledges with ACK receive of each correct packet from client by sending five ACKs, one ACK for each 5 received packets.

The client then sends another five packets (Packet 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to the server, emulating one correct packet and four packets with errors.
The server acknowledges with ACK receive of correct packet from client, and with corresponding Reject sub codes for packets with errors. 

The client will start an ack_timer at the time the packet is sent to the server, if the ACK (Acknowledge) for each packet has not been received during ack_timer period by client before expiration of timer then client should retransmit the packet that was sent before.
The timer can be set at 3 seconds (recommended) and a retry counter should be used for resending the packet. If the ACK for the packet does not arrive before the timeout, the client will retransmit the packet and restart the ack_timer, and the ack_timer should be reset for a total of 3 times.
If no ACK was received from the server after resending the same packet 3 times, the client should generate the following message and display on the screen: 
“Server does not respond”.

### Error handling:

NOTE: All four error handling messages below should be simulated and displayed on the screen, the error response messages should be included in a (.pdf, .png, .jpg) file and turned in with your source code.


ACK error handling:
If the ACK timer expires and the ACK from server has not been received by client, an error message should be displayed on the screen by client prior to resending the packet.

Reject error handling with sub code:

Case-1: An error message should be displayed on the screen when the received packet at server is not in sequence with expected packet from client; an error message should be generated by server and sent to client.
	For example, if server receives packets 0, 1 and then 3, packet 3 is out of sequence because the server is expecting the packet 2 after receiving the packet 1. The server will not increment the expected sequence number until packet 2 has been received.

Case-2: The server receives a packet which its length field does not match the length of data in the payload’s field, an error message should be generated by server and send to the client.
	For example, if the length field of a received packet indicates the data payload is 125 bytes, but the actual payload is only 12 bytes, this packet has a length mismatch error.

Case-3: The server receives a packet which does not have the End of Packet Identifier, an error message should be generated by server and send to the client.
	For example, if the last byte of the packet is xFFF0, this packet has a missing end of packet identifier error.

Case-4: The server receives a duplicated packet (sequence number), an error message should be generated by server and send to the client.
	For example, if server receives packets 0, 1 and then packet 1 again, the second packet 1 is a duplicate packet, the server will not increment the expected sequence number.
